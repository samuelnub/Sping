	ey, bgfx is just giving me the biggest headache of all time, so I think I'm gonna stick with pure OGL (just hope khronos doesnt abandon it for vk)
	just main.cpp for now. uh, trying a different file structure, everything is PascalCase, and I'm gonna make the edgy move of putting .cpp and .h files in the same place
	I'll need to implement a thread pool if I want to do generation and rendering and all that juicy stuff in one frame
	wrap all your shiz in a namespace

	took a threadpool implementation from https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool
	see its example.cpp, use lambdas
	use it for time-costly stuff like file io or mesh generation dispatch etc...
	try making a separate input class and event "dispatch" class (try actually implementing the actual observer pattern this time)

	basic windower up, working!
	next time you should check if classes can be usable or if theyre still being modified by the threadpool
	linker, add SDL2.lib AND SDL2main.lib, just need SDL2.dll in your working dir.

	might want to look into RapidXML, header only, and its performance looks pretty impressive compared to tinyxml
